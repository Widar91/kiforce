                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Over my career I've seen many trainers sticking to the same exercises and giving a simple diet to their customers, hoping that would be enough for them to transform - back than I was one of them. At the beginning that could be enough to see a little change but after a few weeks people hit a plateau and their body stops changing. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Over many years I've been obsessed about changing both mine and my client's bodies and I've realised that simply focusing on training and nutrition is not enough, you also need to take into account variables like a person's schedule, his mindset and motivation and how he keeps himself accountable to his goals. That's why I have developed a <b><i>method</i></b> that could help <b><i>anybody</i></b> to achieve a real body transformation.
