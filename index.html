                    The Ki-Force method takes personal training to a whole different level. 
                </p>
                <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                    My name is Davide Alfonsi and I am the go to trainer in Angel Islington, Essex Road and Highbury. My training method is especially designed for people that aspire to accomplish a great change in life because it wisely combines the science of mindfulness with the most cutting edge training and nutrition strategies.
                </p>
                <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                    Fitness has always been my biggest passion and I have been helping people to get in shape for more than ten years. During my career I had the privilege to work with some of the UK top 500 celebrities, international public speakers, movie directors, CEOs, world class musicians and many other amazing people from any walk of life. Using my system I have always helped them to get in shape, reduce stress and gain the necessary confidence to thrive in life.
                </p>
                <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                    I believe that the fitness industry has been missing the whole point by putting too much focus on training and nutrition but not considering that, at the end of the day, we are just humans and not robots that blindly follow “the best plan”.
                </p>
                <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                    The Ki-Force method breaks the barriers of normal training by implementing mindset strategies to guarantee compliance and deliver results in the easiest and most effective way. By building simple healthy habits week after week my system is able to make the fitness lifestyle enjoyable even with a busy schedule...all this without compromising what you truly love.
