                If you want to transform your body and change your life - then I'm the one for you!
            </p>
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                I specialise in radical body transformations for highly motivated people that are willing to improve their look and lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                With over seven years in the industry I have worked with a huge variety of individuals: from BBC celebrities to top CEOs...but also normal people that are striving for more in life.
            </p>
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                I have been mentored by top experts in the field like Rehan Jalali (Hollywood superstar trainer that coached Ben Afflek, Stallone, Halle Berry and such), Pete Cohen (world famous speaker) and Neil Hill (UK n1 bodybuilding coach). I truly believe that
                coaching is an essential part of life if we strive to become a better version of ourselves.
            </p>
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                I use a unique system that takes into account your daily schedule, your needs and progressively builds healthy habits to achieve your goals. You can download my free ebook <b><a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-download-brochure">Five Keys to Weight Loss</a></b>.
            </p>
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                My sessions are always intense but highly fun. I acknowledge that most people looking for a trainer may be intimidated by the gym environment, that’s why I alway use a gradual approach that includes a lot of theory before going crazy with the weights.
                You will learn a lot about how your body works and hot create a sustainable change that will last for life. The knowledge you will gain during the session will be an invaluable asset in your future.
            </p>
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify">
                Transforming your body is a journey that involves slowly changing your unhealthy habits and gaining the confidence to push a bit harder in order to achieve real results...but it also requires you to have fun and enjoy exercise! I always make sure that
                we have a great time during the sessions by listening to you and having a few genuine laughs.
