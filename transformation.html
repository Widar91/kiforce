                                Rian started training with me to get ready for his summer holiday. He had only 10 weeks to get rid of a lot of fat and build some solid muscle. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The program was though but by keeping the Goal in sight, limiting carbs and recording everything to use progress as a driving force we managed to achieve an incredible transformation in a short amount of time.

                                Nora had less than three months to prepare for her beach wedding so we had to implement strategies to burn fat while keeping the muscles toned.

                            <p>
                                We used a carb back loading technique so that she would be strict during the day but flexible in the evening.

                                In only 12 weeks she got in the best shape of her life while still enjoying food and casual drinks with friends.

                                Matteo was already training by himself but he asked me to help him, his goal was to become a fashion model and he needed an incredible physique.

                                I had to develop a structured vegan diet and supplement protocol to guarantee fat loss and muscles building at the same time.

                                It was hard work and a totally new experience but we managed to achieve great results. He fell in love with training and healthy lifestyle and he started a vegan food business following his new passion.

                                Dan was not very motivated and he loved eating out and occasional drinks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the very start he got into weight training and the quick progress kept him motivated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He started using a food diary and calculating his daily food intake to make sure he would keep growing muscles while getting rid of the extra fat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m very proud to say that the increased confidence and energy led him to start his own business and buying his first flat in London. Well done Dan.

                                Roxanne had a very stressful job and found herself going out and eating too much to distract herself. She asked for my help because she wanted to feel sexy and confident once again.

                                After implementing our method and planning her days around her workout she managed to get in great shape while still enjoying time with her friends and performing even better at work.

                                Henry had a successful business but he was overweight, tired and mildly depressed. We started training and I scanned the area to find healthy choices at his favourite restaurants since he didn’t like to cook. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a couple of months he dropped 1.5 stones and increased his energy and confidence levels. With his new body and confidence he started dating again and in a very short period of time he found a loving partner and they moved in together.

                                Joe is a successful entrepreneur with a very high competitive spirit. He often had to attend many business meetings that involved eating and drinking and he also had to fly to US or China almost weekly. He wanted to get better shape but he needed a challenge to feel motivated. He decided to run his first marathon and he asked my help.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                We started a training and diet plan that could fit his very busy schedule. In three months he lost a stone and gained a lot energy and self discipline with food. I am proud to say that he managed to finish the London marathon with a great time while also raising thousands of pounds for charity. A great success.

                               Steve started training with me to prepare for his wedding. He had Chron’s disease and therefore was hard for him to increase muscle mass. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We planned a postural and anabolic workout he could perform with my help or by his own, combined with a very mild diet program that still allowed his casual drinks with friends. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The result was great and he is still training by himself today using the Ki-Force principles.
